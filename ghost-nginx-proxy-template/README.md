# Ghost Nginx Proxy Template

This Nginx configuration template is a Ghost specific template meant to be used
in conjunction with [jwilder/docker-gen](https://github.com/jwilder/docker-gen)
in the context of [JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion](https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion).

This template and it's usage was inspired by this post from Louis King ([jinglemansweep](https://github.com/jinglemansweep)):
